This paper argues that aging results from loss of epigenetic information, not just molecular damage. Key claims: 

Epigenetic dysregulation is a core molecular mechanism (Q2: Yes).
Epigenetic age is a biomarker of biological aging (Q1: Yes).
Species differences in lifespan are explained by fidelity of epigenetic maintenance (Q5: Yes).
Naked mole-rats maintain epigenetic stability longer, explaining their longevity (Q6: Yes).
Partial epigenetic reprogramming can reverse aging (Q4: No).
Longevity interventions: OSK gene therapy (Q3: Yes).
Birds and body size effects are not discussed (Q7: No, Q8: No).
Calorie restriction is mentioned but not explained mechanistically (Q9: No).
