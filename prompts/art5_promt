--- BEGIN ARTICLE TEXT ---
This paper proposes that aging stems from the breakdown of bioelectric patterns that maintain tissue morphology ("morphostatic information"). It suggests: 

Bioelectric signatures (e.g., transmembrane voltage gradients) serve as aging biomarkers (Q1: Yes).
Ion channel dysregulation is a molecular mechanism (Q2: Yes).
Reprogramming bioelectric networks (e.g., with ion channel drugs) is a longevity intervention (Q3: Yes).
Aging is reversible by restoring bioelectric patterns (Q4: No).
However, the paper does not address:
Species lifespan differences (Q5: No),
Naked mole-rats (Q6: No),
Birds (Q7: No),
Body size effects (Q8: No),
Calorie restriction (Q9: No).
