--- BEGIN ARTICLE TEXT ---
This paper proposes that aging may have evolved as a defense against pathogens. By limiting the lifespan of individuals, aging reduces the time window for pathogen transmission, thereby protecting kin groups. The theory suggests that senescence acts as a form of "altruistic suicide" to limit epidemic spread. It explains: 

Why long-lived species (e.g., birds, naked mole-rats) often have enhanced pathogen resistance.
Why large animals (with lower population density) can afford longer lifespans.
Why calorie restriction, which reduces metabolic activity and pathogen replication, extends lifespan.
The paper explicitly links pathogen pressure to interspecies differences in longevity and suggests that immune robustness is a key factor in exceptional longevity.
