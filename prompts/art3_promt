--- BEGIN ARTICLE TEXT ---
This paper presents a causal network of the hallmarks of aging, identifying primary drivers (e.g., genomic instability, epigenetic alterations) and secondary consequences. It proposes that: 

Epigenetic clocks are robust biomarkers of aging pace and mortality risk (Q1: Yes).
These clocks also explain differences in maximum lifespan across species (Q5: Yes).
Interventions like partial reprogramming can reverse aging (Q4: No).
Calorie restriction works by modulating nutrient-sensing pathways (e.g., mTOR, sirtuins) (Q9: Yes).
Large animals live longer due to evolved tumor suppression mechanisms (Peto’s paradox) (Q8: Yes).
Birds’ longevity is linked to efficient DNA repair and mitochondrial function (Q7: Yes).
Naked mole-rats are not discussed (Q6: No).
Longevity interventions (e.g., reprogramming, senolytics) are explicitly suggested (Q3: Yes).
